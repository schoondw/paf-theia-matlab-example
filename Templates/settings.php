$track_rotated_people = false; // Option to better track people not standing up (upside down or laying down for example). Default is false since it increases the processing time when used. 
$export_type = "C3D"; // The data can be exported into a C3D or a FBX file with different conventions. Allowed entries: "C3D", "FBXTHEAI3D", "FBXMAYAYUP", "FBXMAYAZUP", "FBXMAX", "FBXMOTIONBUILDER", "FBXOPENGL", "FBXDIRECTX", "FBXLIGHTWAVE" or "FBXCUSTOM". Default is "C3D".
					  // Important: The V3D analysis requires using "C3D". Although using other entries than "C3D" will also export C3D file(s), it will make the analysis fail because selecting one of the FBX export types changes the Theia skeleton/model convention.
